## FAQ ##

#### License-?
These libraries are in the public domain. Do what you want with them -- though
an attribution would be nice. And if you use them for something cool, feel free
to send me a link or something. :)

#### Why single-file?
Because you can just drop it into your project without hassle.

#### Why C?
It's my favorite. More justifiably: high portability, easier binding to all your
favorite scripting languages, etc.

#### Why public domain?
I want people to use the code if it will help them, and I don't want them to
have to deal with the silliness of licensing questions or compliance.
